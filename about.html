                <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
                <p>We are a team of High-Schoolers (one college graduate) who make games. The team was founded by current CEO, John Fiore, and was Co-Founded by the current COO, Nick Armes. Our games mainly release for PC, but we hope to release VR titles as well. We have previously released <strong>ONE GAME</strong>, but it is no longer on the market, and we don't talk about it. Our future titles use the Unity Game Engine, which uses the C# Programming Language.</p>
                <p>To see more info about the people who make these games go from dreams to reality, see the <a href="crew.html">crew page.</a></p>
